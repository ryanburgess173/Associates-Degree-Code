Burgess CDs, Tapes, and Vinyl Web Store
eCommerce Website Project

For my final project for WEB-250, I’ve decided to create an ecommerce site focused on
selling music in non-digital formats. This day and age it’s just too difficult to go to a store and
find good music that isn’t on the Billboard 200 or scratched up in a pile of old junk at Goodwill.
This web store will allow people to search out working CDs, Vinyl, and Tapes of the specific
albums they’re looking for, all at a reasonable price.

My website will allow users to buy a wide range of tested and working Vinyl, Cassette
Tapes, and CDs, like how you would on eBay, all in one place. These will range from used to
new, from 1930s Mississippi Blues to modern day Hip-Hop. In the digital music world, we have
Apple Music and Spotify, but I envision a place for non-digital music formats, that place being
Burgess CDs, Tapes, and Vinyl.

Not only will this be a place for those who want to find used and new CDs, Vinyl, and
Tapes, but will feature reviews of individual albums written by contributors. As somebody who
listens to a wide range of music daily, the initial reviews will be written by yours truly, with
future reviews being maintained by an approved list of contributors with a solid knowledge of
music. This site will act as a guide for people interested in discovery different types of music,
groups, and albums.

As a musician and enormous music fan ever since I was a kid, finding good music in a
non-digital format is most definitely a task. There are only a couple of good stores I know of
between Greensboro and Durham, and even then, the selection is limited by the small store
front. As somebody who collects CDs and knows Vinyl collectors, an online web store that
specializes in new and used music at a reasonable price range would be game changing, and
that is why I have decided to build this web store as my final project for WEB-250.

Home Page Mockup:


For my home page I laid out my header, navigation, main content, and footer layouts in
a wireframe above. You can see here there will be a title and subtitle in our header, a
navigation menu containing buttons/links to our home page, about page, CDs page, Vinyl page,
Tapes page, and Contact Us page. Next, we have 3 recently reviewed albums, each item
containing a picture, title, artist, and reviewer name. Finally, in our footer, we have more links
just like the top, including an additional link to the administrator login screen.
I believe my home page is simple, informative, and aesthetically pleasing. I believe this
will attract the creative types that seek the types of musical formats that will be sold on my site
and encourage them to explore my web store more. I look forward to investing time into
developing custom CSS and implementing Bootstrap in order to create a great user experience
for our creative users.

Technologies I plan to utilize:
 * PHP
 * MySQL
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * Bootstrap
 * JavaScript
 * jQuery
