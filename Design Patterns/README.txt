- Amber alerts are an example of design patterns

 - Design Patterns aren't necessarily reuse of code, but reuse of EXPERIENCE

MVC (model view controller) - Crucial for getting jobs/internships
 - a common modern design pattern
 - almost all websites and mobile apps use MVC if done correctly
 - M (model) is your database (usually written in SQL)
 - V (view) HTML pages, what you see in the browser (JS, jQuery, CSS also)
 - V contains ZERO logic.
 - view never EVER talks to the model
 - C (controller) is where all your logic goes. It interacts with the V (view)
   to get the data and hands it to the UI (user interface).
 - Most of a programmer's time is spent in the C (controller).
